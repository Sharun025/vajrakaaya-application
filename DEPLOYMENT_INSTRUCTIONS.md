# 🚀 Vajrakaaya Application - Hostinger Deployment Guide

## 📋 **Deployment Method: Static Hosting (Recommended)**

Since Node.js deployment is having issues, we'll use **Static Hosting** which works perfectly with your Business plan.

---

## 🛠️ **Step-by-Step Deployment:**

### **Step 1: Access Hostinger File Manager**
1. Log into your Hostinger account
2. Go to **"Websites"** → **"Manage"**
3. Click on your domain: `navajowhite-albatross-713944.hostingersite.com`
4. Click **"File Manager"**

### **Step 2: Navigate to Public HTML**
1. In File Manager, navigate to **`public_html`** folder
2. This is your website's root directory

### **Step 3: Upload Files**
1. **Upload `index.php`** to the `public_html` folder
2. **Upload `.htaccess`** to the `public_html` folder
3. **Create a `build` folder** in `public_html`
4. **Upload ALL contents** from your local `build` folder to the `build` folder on Hostinger

### **Step 4: File Structure on Hostinger**
Your `public_html` should look like this:
```
public_html/
├── index.php
├── .htaccess
└── build/
    ├── index.html
    ├── static/
    │   ├── css/
    │   ├── js/
    │   └── media/
    └── asset-manifest.json
```

## 📁 **Files to Upload:**

### **From your local project:**
- ✅ `public_html/index.php` (already created)
- ✅ `public_html/.htaccess` (already created)
- ✅ `build/` folder contents (from `npm run build`)

### **Upload these files to Hostinger:**
1. **`index.php`** → `public_html/index.php`
2. **`.htaccess`** → `public_html/.htaccess`
3. **`build/index.html`** → `public_html/build/index.html`
4. **`build/static/`** → `public_html/build/static/`
5. **`build/asset-manifest.json`** → `public_html/build/asset-manifest.json`

## ✅ **Step 5: Test Your Application**

1. **Visit your domain**: `https://navajowhite-albatross-713944.hostingersite.com`
2. **Your Vajrakaaya app should be live!** 🎉

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting:**

### **If you see "Build files not found":**
- Check if `build` folder exists in `public_html`
- Verify all files from `build` folder are uploaded
- Check file permissions (should be 644 for files, 755 for folders)

### **If React Router doesn't work:**
- Verify `.htaccess` file is uploaded correctly
- Check if Apache mod_rewrite is enabled (should be by default)

### **If styles don't load:**
- Check if `build/static/css/` files are uploaded
- Verify file paths in browser developer tools

### **If JavaScript doesn't work:**
- Check if `build/static/js/` files are uploaded
- Look for console errors in browser developer tools
